Details of public data used as model input variables in this project can be found in the "Data and Methods" section of the manuscript. The process used for pre-processing data and running the XGBoost machine learning model is:

1) Save input variable data time series as a .csv file with 3-digit glacierid at the start of each file. Data should be formatted with a header row, a 'Date' column and a 'Mean Variable' column (or revise processing codes to fit your schema). 
2) Run processing_scripts/GCV_Fitting.ipynb.
3) Run processing_scripts/SSA.ipynb.
4) Run processing_scripts/create_main_df_by_glacier.ipynb.
5) Run xgboost_model.ipynb.

When running the above scripts, you'll need to set your own file paths for input files and output files, as these have been simplified.
